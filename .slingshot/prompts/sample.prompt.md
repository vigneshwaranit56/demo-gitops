  SAMPLE LOCAL PROMPT
  ───────────────────────────────
  Welcome to your Slingshot Local Prompt setup!

  ───────────────────────────────
  HOW IT WORKS
  ───────────────────────────────
  You can add your own ".prompt.md" files under either of these folders available at the root of your repository
  (In case you don't see these folders, you can either create them manually or follow the steps mentioned below):

      • .slingshot/prompts/   ← recommended option
      • .github/prompts/

  All prompt files with the ".prompt.md" extension inside these folders are automatically available in the Prompt Select Drawer.

  HOW TO CREATE A PROMPT
  ───────────────────────────────
  You can create a new prompt file by:
    • Clicking on "Add/Edit Prompt File" from the Slash Command Drawer
      OR
    • Running the Slingshot command "Create or Open Prompt File"

  ───────────────────────────────
  HOW TO USE A PROMPT
  ───────────────────────────────
  You can use your local prompt by:
    • Clicking on "Attach Prompt Commands" from the Slash Command Drawer
      OR
    • Typing the shortcut key "~" in the chat input box

  The filename of your prompt will act as the command name.
  You can use multiple local prompts at a time, but only one non-local prompt.

  ───────────────────────────────
  USING PLACEHOLDERS AND VARIABLES
  ───────────────────────────────
  You can reference the following VSCode workspace variables in your prompts: 
  When creating custom prompts, users can reference the following workspace variables to dynamically insert context-specific information:

- ${userHome}: Path of the user's home folder.
- ${workspaceFolder}: Path of the folder opened in VS Code.
- ${workspaceFolderBasename}: Name of the folder opened in VS Code without any slashes (/).
- ${file}: Currently opened file.
- ${fileWorkspaceFolder}: Currently opened file's workspace folder.
- ${relativeFile}: Currently opened file relative to workspaceFolder.
- ${relativeFileDirname}: Currently opened file's dirname relative to workspaceFolder.
- ${fileBasename}: Currently opened file's basename.
- ${fileBasenameNoExtension}: Currently opened file's basename with no file extension.
- ${fileExtname}: Currently opened file's extension.
- ${fileDirname}: Currently opened file's folder path.
- ${fileDirnameBasename}: Currently opened file's folder name.
- ${cwd}: Task runner's current working directory upon the startup of VS Code.
- ${lineNumber}: Currently selected line number in the active file.
- ${columnNumber}: Currently selected column number in the active file.
- ${selectedText}: Currently selected text in the active file.
- ${execPath}: Path to the running VS Code executable.
- ${pathSeparator}: Character used by the operating system to separate components in file paths.

  Additionally, you can define custom placeholders such as "{file_name}". These placeholders can be replaced with specific values when the prompt is used.

  **Rules for Placeholders:**
  - Do not include special characters like "?", "*", "+", "^", "|", "&", "!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "(", ")", "=", "[", "]", ";", ":", "'", """, "<", ">", ",", ".", "/", "", "~", and "" ` "" within placeholders.
  - Do not use double curly brackets "{{}}".
  - Ensure placeholders are clearly defined and meaningful.

      - Ensure code readability with meaningful variable and function names
      - Maintain consistent formatting and indentation
      - Avoid deep nesting and keep functions short and focused
      - Handle errors and exceptions gracefully
      - Write efficient and performant logic
      - Add comments where necessary for complex logic
      - Follow security best practices and avoid hardcoding secrets
      - Include necessary input validations and edge case handling
      - Prefer reusability and modularity over duplication
      - Follow project-specific coding conventions and linting rules
